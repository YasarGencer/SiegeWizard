### Game Summary
This project was made for GGJ 2022. And it was my first game jam experience. Theme was duality. We created a wizard who can time travel to before and after the invasion. That was our duality. Goal is to reach the door in correct time. There is a unique time changing mechanic in this game and it works like a charm.
